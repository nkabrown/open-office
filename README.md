# C4Q Access Code

http://www.c4q.nyc/accesscode

Access Code is a 10 month training program that makes getting diversity into tech a priority.

Cohorts are designed to be at least 50% women, 50% underrepresented minorities in tech, 50% immigrants, and 60% without 4-year college degrees.

Come join me on Monday or Wednesday nights as an Open Office Lead or volunteer as a Mentor.
