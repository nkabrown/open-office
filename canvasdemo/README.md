## Move the bubble

## First
Don't delete any of my code :) - it'll cause things to break. Just add more onto it.

## Up and Down
Right now the bubble should move left and right - make it move up and down by changing the `handleClick` function `game.js` and adding functions to `bubble.js`.

## Stay within the canvas
Right now the bubble actually moves off the board. You need to keep it on the board.

## Have the bubble move on its own
Create a button that causes the bubble to move in random directions on its own. **hint: setinterval()**
