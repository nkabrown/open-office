# Pursuit Core

https://www.pursuit.org/core

Pursuit Core is a 10 month training program that makes getting diversity into tech a priority.

Pursuit (formerly C4Q) is a social impact organization that creates transformation where it’s needed most. Through our four-year intensive program, we train adults with the most need and potential to gain their first tech jobs, advance in their careers, and become the next generation of leaders in tech. Our graduates are hired by leading companies like Pinterest, Kickstarter, LinkedIn, BlackRock, and JPMorgan Chase, and on average go from making $18,000 to over $85,000 yearly. In addition to training and career support, Pursuit’s innovative operating model combines partnerships with tech companies to retrain their blue-collar workers and social impact investments to re-envision funding for outcomes-based organizations. By connecting talent with opportunity, we empower graduates to bring change to their families, tech companies, and communities across the nation.

Come join me on Thursday nights as an Open Office Lead or volunteer as a Mentor.
